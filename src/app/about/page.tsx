      <p>Balancing science and emotion runs deep in our veins. Our founder, Dr. Eric Abecassis has always personified – in his own ways – the beauty that sits at the intersection of technology and passion.</p>
      <p>Eric has achieved the kind of sport-life balance that many of us only dream of. Luckily, he’s brought together a valuable team of like-minded sports and life enthusiasts, experts in training, AI, machine learning, recovery, and more, and we’ve now empowered an app to help everyone do the same – regardless if you’re at the beginning, middle, or peak of your training journey.</p>
